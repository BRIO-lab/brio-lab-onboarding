# JTML Part 1: Getting Set Up

To start, we aren't going to worry too much about research-type things; rather, we are going to get all the necesary software and programming languages downloaded on your computer.

-----------

1. [Request a HiperGator Account (for Gatorlink account holders)](https://www.rc.ufl.edu/access/account-request/)
    * Scott Banks is going to be your faculty sponsor.
    * This will send an email to Dr. Banks for his approval, and once he gives it you should be all set up. If he hasn't responded within a few days, feel free to email him (banks@ufl.edu) to make sure that he got the request.
    * This is what the lab uses to train, test, and deploy neural networks.
2. Download Python and Anaconda
    * [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * [Anaconda Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Download an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write and run Python (or C++) scripts
    * [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) (most powerful)
    * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (lightweight and simple)
    * [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (I've never used this, but it is recommended by many)
    * There are a *ton* of IDEs available, use the one that feels the most natural for you.
    * ``IF YOU ARE WORKING ON C++ CODE, YOU WILL NEED TO DOWNLOAD VISUAL STUDIO COMMUNITY``
4. Create a Github account and download Github Desktop (send me your username!)
    * [Create a Github account](https://github.com/join)
    * [Download Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
    * We are going to use Github to store, share, and collaborate on code. 

-----------


With that, you should be set up and ready to go! Let me know if you have any trouble with downloading this. I encourage you to Google any errors that come up before asking me (with coding and debugging, Google-Fu becomes a crucial skill!).

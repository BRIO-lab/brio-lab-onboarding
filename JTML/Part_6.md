# JTML Part 6: HiperGator Supercomputer

If you have not already requested an account, please do so now (see the first part of this onboarding series for the link).

The HiperGator is the supercomputer at UF that is bringing our institution to the forefront of artificial intelligence research across a broad range of fields. Thanks to a generous grant by NVIDIA and Chris Malachowsky, we have added dozens more NVIDIA GPUs to the system, increasing our computational power even farther.

## Our Lab and HiperGator

Our lab uses the HiperGator resource so that we can train, test, and deploy neural networks without the need of having a physical GPU tower in the lab. This also allows all of us to use the GPUs from home, without having to worry about coming into the lab. While the process is _slightly_ different than running something on your computer, it remains an extremely easy process.

## HiperGator Resources

The main wiki for the HiperGator can be found at: [wiki.rc.ufl.edu](wiki.rc.ufl.edu). This has all the resources necessary to get started using this. I was able to become okay at using these resources after watching about ~45 minutes of videos.

Here are some of the pages that were the most useful for me:

[Getting Started](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Getting_Started)

[New User Training](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/New_user_training)

[SLURM Commands](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/SLURM_Commands)

[Training, Events, and How-To Videos](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Training) - most of my (limited) knowledge came from watching prerecorded videos.

# JTML Part 2: Background Information

You likely joined this project because of some interest in coding/image analysis/medical imaging/machine learning. While all these attributes describe what this project entails, it is useful to know _**why**_ we are using all these tools, and the problems that we hope to solve by applying them.

## Joint Kinematics

### Brief Overview

Within the field of mechanics, kinematics is the study of the motion of particles, objects, rigid bodies, and systems of rigid bodies (if you have taken a dynamics class, you should remember this!). The kinematics of joints (knees, shoulders, ankles, elbows, etc) is exactly what you would expect - the study of the motion of joint systems in the human musculoskeletal system!

# JTML Part 2: Background Information

You likely joined this project because of some interest in coding/image analysis/medical imaging/machine learning. While all these attributes describe what this project entails, it is useful to know _**why**_ we are using all these tools, and the problems that we hope to solve by applying them.

## Joint Kinematics

### Brief Overview

Within the field of mechanics, kinematics is the study of the motion of particles, objects, rigid bodies, and systems of rigid bodies (if you have taken a dynamics class, you should remember this!). The kinematics of joints (knees, shoulders, ankles, elbows, etc) is exactly what you would expect - the study of the motion of joint systems in the human musculoskeletal system! 

### Why Do We Care?

Joint kinematics offer a tremendous deal of information to both researchers and clinicians looking to study and treat various joint pathologies.
Some questions they could ask:

* What is the difference between healthy knee kinematics and osteoarthritic knee kinematics during a lunge activity?
* What is the proper geometry for an implant design to replicate natural knee kinematics during locomotion?
* Is there a difference between shoulder kinematics for dominant and non-dominant shoulder during specific activities?
* Are there any kinematic differences between various postoperative satisfaction levels following total knee arthroplasty?
* Can we predict implant wear patterns by looking at kinematics during various activities?

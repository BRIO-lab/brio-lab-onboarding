So, now you might be wondering: what _exactly_ does this lab do?

The main purpose of our efforts is to assist Orthopaedic Surgeons. We do that in _a lot_ of different ways, including, but not limited to:

   * [Joint Kinematics and Kinematics Analysis](https://github.com/BRIO-lab/brio-lab-onboarding/blob/main/General/resources/kinematics.md)
   * [Implant Testing]()
   * [Robotics and Controls Systems](https://github.com/BRIO-lab/brio-lab-onboarding/blob/main/General/resources/robotics.md)

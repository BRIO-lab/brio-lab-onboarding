So, now you might be wondering: what _exactly_ does this lab do?

The main purpose of our efforts is to assist Orthopaedic Surgeons. We do that in _a lot_ of different ways, including, but not limited to:

   * Joint Kinematics and Kinematics Analysis
   * Implant Testing    
   * Robotics and Controls Systems

# Part 1: The Basics
[Next](https://github.com/BRIO-lab/brio-lab-onboarding/blob/main/General/Part_2.md)

It's your first day in the (B)iomechanics, (R)obotics, and (I)maging in (O)rthopaedics Lab! You've likely ended up at this page because you spoke with Dr. Banks about joining a lab! Hopefully you've been connected with a graduate student with a project on that you can work. If you do not have a graduate student mentor, reach out to Dr. Banks or any of the graduate students based on your interests, and we will get you set up on something. Everyone is extremely friendly, so please don't be afriad to ask around!

The first things that you should take care of are not research-related.

-------------

1. Pick out a desk in NSC 209 (this is location in the hallway between the Wertheim Building and Nuclear Sciences). Sit anywhere there's an open spot.
2. Reach out to Andrew (ajensen123@ufl.edu) or Xheni (xbare@ufl.edu) to be added to the Lab's Slack Channel.
